        <p>This project was an assignment for INFO201 Spring 2020 quarter.
        The assignment was a group project to create a data visualization website revolving
        around a specific dataset. </p>
        <p>Working with three other people, me and my team decided to focus on environmental
        data, specifically revolving around global warming and emissions. Using multiple datasets,
        we worked together to create three different interactive graphs.</p>
        <p>This project was programmed in R and turned into a web app through Shiny.
        While we worked together on many aspects of the site, some of my main responsibilities
        were creating and designing the look of the website.</p>
        <p>You can view the site by clicking on the image above or <a href=
          "https://info201-ag4-final.shinyapps.io/final-project-AG4/" target="_blank">here</a>,

        </div>
      </center>        <p>"Press A to Begin" is a 10 page zine I wrote and designed myself!
        After taking a film class that had a unit on the history and importance
        of zines in subcultures, I was inspired to make one myself digitally
        rather than using the more common handmade methods. This zine falls
        under the fanzine and personal zine genres and is about my love of video
        games and the experiences I've had around 10 specific video games.</p>
        <p>The zine was designed and created using Adobe Photoshop during Winter
        2020 over a few weeks. You can read it by clicking on the image above,
        or by clicking <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6hiya28il8ed4o2/zine.pdf?dl=0"

            reviews and look at the restaurant's menu. The final screen shown,
            titled Accomodation Form, allows users to type out their name,
            when they want to make restaurant reservations, and allows them
            to type in many different accomodations they will need for their
            meal and anything else necessary for them while at the restaurants.
            All of the screens are a pale green color with white menus and

        <p>This project was an assignment for my INFO200 course in Winter 2020.
        The assignment was to design a non-commerical information system
        to solve some sort of issue people experience. Working with a team member,
        we had to design a solution to our issue, identify its benefits and
        harms, how information is exchanged within it, and decide how people
        interact with it.</p>
        <p> Me and my teammate decided to focus on the issues people with dietary
        restrictions encounter while eating out in public. We designed an idea
        for an app titled Accomodate that would allow people to set reservations
        at restaurants with their eating accomodations and disabilities in mind.
        </p>
        <p>The project was a written report that required visual aids, and along with
          writing many sections of the project, I was responsible for designing
          what the UI of the app would look like. The design was created by me
          in Adobe Photoshop.
        </p>

        <p><b>This part of my portfolio is still under construction.</b> More
          projects will be added soon to better show off my skills!</p>
        <p>These are some of the pieces I photoshopped as part of my DMA120 &
          DMA220 (Beginning Photoshop and Intermediate Photoshop) course taken
          at Olympic College during Winter and Spring 2019. Click on the images
          for full quality!</p>
        <p>Many of the designs are busier than I would have liked, as the
          grading critera relied on doing a number of manipulations and using
          many different images to create a composite image. I mostly
          included them in this portfolio to demonstrate the different
          techincal skills I've learned.

        <p>This was the final project for my Spring 2019 class. The assignment
        was to make a poster for a movie or show, and I chose to make a poster
        for the show Twin Peaks. Some of the grading requirements were to
        utilize the Photoshop 3D elements, creating a reflection in water and in
        glass, and coloring layers.</p>

        <p>This was the final project for my Winter 2019 class. I chose to
          design a tracklist for a Florence and the Machine album. The main
          technique we were being graded on was using spot healing and healing
          brush tools to completely remove something from an image and replace
          it -- the painting to the left had a person in it that was completely
          removed with the artist added in place.</p>

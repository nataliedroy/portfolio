      <p> My name is <b>Natalie Roy</b>! I use <b>she/her</b> pronouns and I'm
        currently a junior at <b>University of Washington Seattle</b> pursuing
        a Bachelor's degree in <b>Geography Data Science</b>, with minors in
        <b>English</b> and <b>Informatics</b>.

      <h2> About me </h2>
      <p>I grew up in Bremerton, Washington and graduated from Central Kitsap
        High School in 2019. I am a first generation college student and participated
        in Running Start in high school, earning an Associate's degree alongside
        my high school degree. I'm in the process of earning my Bachelors degree at UW
        Seattle. I have a strong passion for accessibility and diversity, and I have
        career goals of working somewhere in information technology. </p>

      <p>Currently, I am working at <b>UW-IT Academic Technologies</b> as a
        <b>Learning Technologies Consultant</b>. I help the staff, students, and faculty
        of UW with tools like Canvas, Zoom, and Panopto through email, phone, and in-person
        consultations. Most of my duties include QA testing and helping provide solutions
        to encountered issues, often in a fast-paced environment.
      </p>

      <p>Additionally, I am a paid writer for UW's student newspaper <b>The Daily</b>.
        I write for the Arts + Culture section, and run a column that reviews student
        and faculty member's favorite coming-of-age films. All of my articles can be read
        under the "Writing" tab.

        <h2> This Website </h2>
        <p>This website was programmed entirely by me in the Summer of 2020 and
          was <b>last updated on 1/16/22</b>.</p>
        <p> The website is scalable and works for devices of any screen. Alt text
          descriptions have been written for all images for screenreaders and any
          other purposes. If anything on this website needs to be changed for
          improved accessibility, please message me and I will implement it
          as best as I can! </p>
